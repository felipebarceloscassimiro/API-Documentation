# API Documentation Challenge

## Overview

This repository was created to complete an API documentation challenge. My goal was to practice and learn how to effectively use **Markdown** while working on API documentation. For this challenge, I documented an extremely simple API that simulates employee management operations. 

The API used for this challenge can be found at the following link:

[Dummy Employee API](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/)

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to document the basic features of the API, including creating general descriptions, cURL commands, and usage guides aimed at entry-level users. Here are the tasks that were provided as part of the challenge:

> ### API Documentation - Getting Started
>
> To complete this challenge, you should have knowledge of manual API testing and API reference documentation expertise. It is recommended to use any API tester such as Postman, ThunderClient, or your preferred tool.
>
> #### Instructions:
> 1. Write a general description that accurately describes the features and functionalities of this API.
> 2. Create the cURL commands and JSONs for `/employee/{id}` and `/create`. Explain the results a user should expect when making these calls.
> 3. State and explain the required fields for `/employee` and what kind of data they can hold. What other elements should be included, in your opinion?
> 4. Make a guide explaining to an entry-level user how to use the `/employee` and `/delete/{id}` features. Ensure you use screenshots and all necessary visual elements to convey an accurate and complete explanation.

## Repository Structure

- **Documents/**: Contains all the markdown files used to document the API and guide users through the necessary steps.
- **Images/**: Stores all screenshots and visual elements used to make the documentation more accessible.

## Tools Used

- **Postman**: Used for testing API endpoints.
- **Markdown**: For formatting the documentation.
- **Dummy Employee API**: API used to complete the challenge.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this challenge, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- Writing API documentation using **Markdown** effectively.
- Testing APIs using tools like **Postman**.
- Structuring a repository to include relevant documentation and images.

## Next Steps

This repository can be further expanded to include more advanced API features or integrated into more complex documentation setups. Future improvements could include automated testing scripts or interactive documentation formats.

I hope this repository showcases my ability to learn new tools quickly while focusing on delivering clear and concise documentation.
